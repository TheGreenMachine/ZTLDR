## Important Places to Look for Rookies

Here's some places you should look at to figure out how the robot works:
- Any subsystem. Subsystems will show you how we actually move parts of the robot, manage states, etc.
  - It's recommended to look at the subsystems in the order of:
    1. Feeder
    2. Gatekeeper
    3. Climber/Intake
    4. Shooter
  - Remember to look at the YAML to see how we define constants as well.
