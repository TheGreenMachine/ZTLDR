I know this isn't what it'll actually be structured, but this was the ultimate basis of what got need from the night of 1/03.
 (I would recommend worrying about the initialAngle & initialVelocity later and just starting with start/end pose(will change as the robot moves) & distance)
 There's some code in the .md file + our initial implementation of distance.
